Experiment for implementing new loss functions in place of log likelihood

## Anomaly Detection Experiments

This repository contains code for anomaly detection experiments using different loss functions, including KL divergence, Wasserstein, and Cross-Entropy loss.

### Original Repository

This code is based on the work from ([https://github.com/xcyao00/BGAD.git]).
